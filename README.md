# commute

Welcome to the repository for Commute! Commute is a simple Telegram bot that I wrote with the intention to aid me with public transportation in Singapore. It's mostly meant for personal use, but feel free to check it out anyway and tweak it for your use!

## Motivations

I've been wanting to start a project that uses data from [the Land Transport Authority's DataMall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg), and what better way than to create a Telegram bot for it? I use Telegram almost daily mainly for school, and it would be nice to have quick information about transport when I need it instead of having to open up a navigation app. My current choice for public transport is [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com), and although it works great, I'd love to have an even faster option!
